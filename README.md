# Flexicog finder

A flexicog is a word where at least one vowel can be replaced with any other vowel and it will still be a valid word.

Example: `pat` is a flexicog, because you can swap the vowel with any other vowel and it's still a word.
`pat`
`pet`
`pit`
`pot`
`put`

According to this program
(and the english dictionary I got from https://www.npmjs.com/package/an-array-of-english-words),
the longest flexicog in the english language is `CL_CKING` (clacking, clecking, clicking, clocking, clucking).
